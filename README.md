# AM and FM Signal Modulation Project

This project explores the generation, modulation, and analysis of various analog signals, focusing on both Amplitude Modulation (AM) and Frequency Modulation (FM). The implementation uses MATLAB to create, modulate, demodulate, and visualize different signals in both time and frequency domains.

## Introduction
This project provides a detailed examination of AM and FM signal processing. It demonstrates how to generate a variety of modulated signals and analyze their characteristics. The project includes DSB-LC AM, DSB-SC AM, SSB-SC AM, and FM modulation techniques.

## Project Components

### Signal Generation
- **Message Signal**: A combination of three cosine signals of different amplitudes and frequencies.
- **Carrier Signal**: A single cosine signal representing the carrier in modulation.

### Amplitude Modulation
- **DSB-LC**: Modulation by multiplying the message signal with the carrier signal.
- **DSB-SC**: Double-sideband suppressed-carrier modulation using MATLAB's `ammod` function.
- **SSB-SC**: Single-sideband suppressed-carrier modulation, implemented with Hilbert transforms.

### Frequency Modulation
- **FM Signal**: Generated by varying the carrier frequency according to the message signal.

## Plotting and Visualization

### Time Domain
- Plots are created for the message signal, carrier signal, and different modulated signals in the time domain.
- The AM and FM signals are displayed in separate subplots to visualize the impact of modulation on amplitude and frequency.

### Frequency Domain
- FFT-based plots to analyze the frequency components of the message, carrier, and modulated signals.
- The plots illustrate the frequency characteristics of DSB-LC, DSB-SC, and SSB-SC AM signals, as well as the FM signal's spectrum for various modulation indices.

## Demodulation
- The FM signal is demodulated to retrieve the original message signal.
- Plots are generated to compare the original message signal with the demodulated output.

## Running the Code
- Ensure you have MATLAB installed.
- Copy and paste the code into a MATLAB script.
- Run the script to generate the plots and examine the output.
- Adjust parameters such as carrier frequency, modulation indices, and signal amplitudes to explore different scenarios and signal characteristics.
